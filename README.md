## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how blockchain technology can bring trust and automation to the crypto trading world.

Here‚Äôs a detailed description of how blockchain-certification integrates with major exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

### Core Concept: What is Blockchain-Certification?

First, let's clarify "blockchain-certification." In this context, it doesn't refer to the exchanges themselves being certified. Instead, it refers to a **third-party, independent service** that uses an immutable blockchain as a notary to:

3.  **Create Trust:** Prove that a trader or fund manager executed the strategy they promised, without manipulation.

This system is often used by fund managers, trading signal providers, and algorithmic traders to build credibility with their investors or followers.
